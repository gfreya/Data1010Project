    "In many fields of research and application, it is usually necessary to observe the data with multiple variables, and then analyze to find the rules via the large amount of data. Multivariate large datasets undoubtedly provide rich information for research and application, but inversely, they will increase the workload of data collection to some extent. Furthermore, there may exist correlations among many variables in many cases, which will definitely increase the complexity of data analysis. If variables are analyzed separately, the analysis is often isolated and the information behind the data cannot be fully utilized. Therefore, the blind reduction of indicators will lose a lot of useful information, resulting in wrong conclusions. But the realistic problem is that huge amount of data cannot be stored and analysed in a reasonable and understandable way. We must find the balance between data utilization and dimension reduction."

    "We can have an intuitive example about the disaster gotten from high dimensional data. Different from text information, image information occupies a large capacity so that its storage and transmission will be greatly limited. Assume there is a still color image and its size is $600\\times800$, which means it's $800$ pixels long and $600$ pixels wide and there are $480000$ poxels on the screen. A pixel of a still color image needs three memory cells, so the single image needs $3*480000=1440000=1406.25$KB disk storage space. If the color image is transmitted at $24$ frames per second, the amount of data per second is $24*1406.25$KB$\\approx33$MB, then a $640$MB CD-ROM can only store about $20$ seconds of original data. With the present technology, it is difficult to meet the storage and transmission needs of the original digital image. We all know that image processing is an important task in the field of machine learning, so it is inevitable that we have to do something on the target images to compress the images and extract important features."

    "Therefore, it is necessary to find a reasonable method to reduce the loss of information contained in the original indicators while reducing the indicators to be analyzed, so as to achieve the purpose of comprehensive analysis of the collected data. Since there is a certain correlation between the variables, we can consider changing the closely related variables into as few new variables as possible, so that these new variables are uncorrelated, then we can use less comprehensive indicators to represent the various kinds of information in each variable. Dimension reduction is a preprocessing method for high dimensional feature data. Dimension reduction is to preserve some of the most important features of high-dimensional data, remove noise and unimportant features, so as to improve the speed of data processing. In the actual production and application, dimension reduction can save us a lot of time and cost in a certain range of information loss. Dimension reduction has become a widely used data preprocessing method and the kind of reduction has several strong points: \n",

    "So how to reduce dimensions like image compressing and features extraction is worth deep thinking. Thanks to the SVD(singular value decomposition), which is a descent algebraic transformation, we can use the optimal matrix decompostion to do the image compression. Meanwhile, there is another similar method called PCA(principle component analysis) which is also used the matrix transformation and decomposition. The two methods have some connections and differences, they also have their own advantages. I want to introduce the mathematical conceptions behind SVD and PCA, explain the connections and differences between the two methods and compare the two methods via same tasks.  "
